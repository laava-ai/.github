# Laava

**Production-grade AI Agents that don't just chat—they execute.**

We engineer agentic systems that read unstructured data, reason through business logic, and take actions in your ERP, CRM, and email systems. Not consultants selling strategy decks—systems engineers who deploy working agents in 4 weeks.

## What We Build

AI Agents that complete transactions, not just conversations:
- **Read** PDFs, emails, and legacy system data
- **Reason** through your business rules with guardrails
- **Execute** in your systems of record with full audit trails

## Our Architecture: 3 Layers

| Layer | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **Context** | Structured metadata, RAG pipelines with citation enforcement |
| **Reasoning** | Model-agnostic AI (GPT-4, Claude, Llama) with adaptive routing |
| **Action** | Deterministic integrations to ERP, CRM, TMS—agents that read AND write |

## Four Equal Pillars

Unlike typical AI shops (90% Data Scientists), we're built on **4 equal engineering disciplines:**

`AI/ML` · `Software Engineering` · `Integration` · `Infrastructure`

A production-grade AI system is only 25% "AI"—the rest is engineering.

## Industries

**Logistics** · **Retail** · **Public Sector** · **Financial Services**

Enterprises with complex processes trapped in PDFs, emails, and legacy systems.

## The 4-Week Proof of Pilot

Week 1: Air-gap audit → Week 2: Architecture blueprint → Week 3: Build → Week 4: Shadow mode with real data

Working agent handling real traffic. Not a demo.
